### The idea: A website for a pet daycare which can offer different services such as: housing and groomig and if needed veterinarian care.
### In order to start the API you need to have:
##### *as data base: mongoDB set up on your computer and optionally mongoCompass(UI) for easily viewing and manipulating data. 
##### *for creating unique authentication tokens: json web tokens - open terminal and set hp_jwtPrivateKey= '*your private key*' as an environment variable.
