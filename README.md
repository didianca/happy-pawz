# Happy Pawz

### The idea: A website designed to support a pet daycare which can offer different services such as: housing and grooming and if needed veterinary care. The API manipulates data such as user and pet information, deals with organization such as rooms, employees and rental services.
#### In order to start the API you need to:
###### *npm init;
###### *as data base: set up mongoDB on your computer(mongodb.com -> server -> download the MSI) and optionally install mongoCompass(UI) for easily viewing and manipulating data;
###### *for creating unique authentication tokens: json web tokens - open terminal and set hp_jwtPrivateKey= '*your private key*' as an environment variable (naming convention: '*hp*' stands for the project's name -HappyPawz- to avoid mixing different environment variables from different projects);
###### *go to index.js: everything is implemented here and u can trace back all the way to each endpoint by following the imports;
######*to start the server: in terminal use '*node index.js*' or for constantly changing code and have the server restart on it's own use : '*nodemon*';
